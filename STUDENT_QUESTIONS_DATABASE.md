# LEVEL 5: Ambiguous/Emotional Questions (1 question)

## L5-EMO-001
**Question:** "Am I smart enough for TUM?"  
**Phase:** 🔍 Discovery  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Persona:** Generic  

**Expected Answer:**  
- Empathetic but redirect to objective criteria
- No promises or guarantees
- Focus on what they can control
- Encourage checking requirements

**Good Answer:**  
"This is a common concern, and it's completely normal to doubt yourself before applying to a top university. 

**Here's the objective reality:**
- TUM's admissions are based on **clear criteria**:  GPA (minimum 2.5), English test scores, relevant Bachelor's degree
- "Smart enough" isn't the question - it's "Do you meet the requirements?"

**Instead of asking "Am I smart enough?", ask:**
1. ✅ "What is my GPA?" (Compare to TUM's 2.5 minimum)
2. ✅ "What are my test scores?" (TOEFL 88 or IELTS 6.5)
3. ✅ "Do I have relevant background?" (CS or related field)

**If you meet these criteria:**
- Yes, you're academically qualified
- Thousands of international students study at TUM - you can too
- Admission is competitive, but meeting requirements means you have a chance

**My advice:**
- Check the requirements objectively
- If you meet them, apply! 
- Prepare a strong application (good motivation letter, recommendation letters)
- Apply to multiple universities (TUM, RWTH, TU Berlin) to increase chances

**Bottom line:** If you meet the academic requirements, you absolutely have the capability to succeed at TUM. The admissions process will evaluate your application - don't disqualify yourself before even trying."

**Why this answer works:**
- ✅ Acknowledges the emotional concern (validates feelings)
- ✅ Redirects to objective, actionable criteria
- ✅ Doesn't make false promises ("You'll definitely get in!")
- ✅ Empowers student to evaluate themselves
- ✅ Encourages action (apply!) rather than self-doubt
- ✅ Provides concrete next steps
