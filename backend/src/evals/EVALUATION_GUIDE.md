# Evaluation Guide

## Purpose
This document aims to provide a comprehensive guide for evaluating LLM frameworks effectively, detailing the methodologies, target user personas, and evaluation criteria specific to our application.

## Framework Architecture
An exploration of the underlying architecture of the evaluation framework, including descriptions of components and their interactions.

## Target User Personas
1. **Ahmet**: A data scientist focused on deploying machine learning models and evaluating their performance.
2. **Elif**: A product manager interested in understanding the user experience and efficiency of LLM applications.
3. **Mehmet**: A software developer responsible for integrating evaluation metrics into applications.

## Question Type Taxonomy
Breakdown of the various types of questions that can be utilized in evaluations, categorized by complexity and expected responses.
