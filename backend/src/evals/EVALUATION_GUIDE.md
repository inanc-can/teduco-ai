# LLM Evaluation Guide

## Purpose
The purpose of this evaluation guide is to establish a comprehensive framework for evaluating language models (LLMs) effectively and systematically. It aims to help organizations understand the performance and applicability of LLMs in various contexts.

## Framework Architecture
The architecture of the framework consists of several layers including data preprocessing, evaluation metrics, modeling, and reporting. Each layer interacts to provide a holistic view of the evaluation process.

## Target User Personas
- **Ahmet**: A data scientist focused on performance metrics and model improvements.
- **Elif**: A project manager interested in understanding the practical applications and impacts of LLMs.
- **Mehmet**: A software engineer integrating LLMs into applications and seeking usability insights.

## Question Type Taxonomy
The taxonomy categorizes the types of questions to assess:
- **Factual Questions**
- **Analytical Questions**
- **Creative Questions**

## Test Case Format
Each test case will be structured to include:
- Test case ID
- Input
- Expected Output
- Actual Output
- Status (Pass/Fail)

## Persona-Aware Evaluation
Evaluations will be tailored based on the target user persona to ensure relevance and usability in real-world applications.

## Turkish-Specific Evaluation Criteria
Criteria to evaluate LLMs in the context of Turkish language capabilities including:
- Linguistic nuances
- Cultural references

## Evaluation Metrics Implementation
Description and implementation plans for metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Evaluation Runner
A dedicated tool to execute evaluation tests and report results automatically.

## Test Datasets
Description of datasets used for testing including:
- Size
- Diversity

## Success Criteria
Establishing success criteria based on performance benchmarks defined in the framework.

## CI/CD Integration
Integrating evaluation processes into the CI/CD pipeline for continuous evaluation and feedback.

## Phased Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1**: Initial setup and basic evaluation metrics implementation.
2. **Phase 2**: Persona-aware evaluations and Turkish-specific criteria implementation.
3. **Phase 3**: Full integration with CI/CD and ongoing improvements.
